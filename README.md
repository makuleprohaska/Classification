# Classification Project Overview 
This was an individual project done as part of the Mathematical Modelling in Machine Learning course at Bocconi University. Each student was assigned their individual data set, wherein each column represented a feature and rows represented samples. We were then tasked with building the most accurate possible classifier possible using SVC and Random Forest techniques, as well as trying another kind (in the case of my project, I chose XGBoost). The dataset later turned out to have been randomized, so whilst the results of this work do not have any real world application, the code itself provides a roadmap for how one would go about building a classifier using the above mentioned techniques.
